I break things apart to understand how they work — whether that's an audio signal, a crypto market cycle, or a Roland SH-101 synthesizer.

Started in sound engineering, ended up in trading rooms and mining farms, now building DSP-powered trading systems for my master's dissertation. The thread connecting all of it? **Signal processing.** Audio signals, financial signals — turns out the math doesn't care which one you feed it.

Based in Bucharest. Originally from Tehran.

**Currently building:**

`crypto-cycle-detection` — A system that uses FFT, MESA, and Hilbert Transform to find dominant cycles in crypto price data, then trades the peaks and troughs. Includes a Streamlit dashboard for backtesting against traditional indicators. *(MSc Dissertation @ Romanian-American University)*

---

**Past work:**

`Classification-of-Music-Genres-Using-CNN-and-GTZAN-dataset` — CNN trained on 1,000 audio samples across 10 genres. 94.89% test accuracy. Built with TensorFlow, Librosa, and a lot of patience over 550 epochs. *(BSc Final Project — Grade A)*

`sh-101-synthesizer` — Rebuilt the Roland SH-101 as a Pure Data patch. VCO, VCF, VCA, LFO, ADSR — the whole signal chain from scratch.

`arduino-instruments` — A collection of hardware-software instruments: touch-sensitive finger drum pads, ultrasonic sensor-controlled sound, all running Arduino → Pure Data.

**What I work with:**

Python · Pandas · NumPy · SciPy · TensorFlow · Scikit-learn · Librosa · Plotly · Streamlit · Pure Data · Max MSP · Arduino · SQL

**Before code, there was trading:**

Head of Trading at a financial holding — managed a $100K+ crypto portfolio and ran a 1,000 TH/s mining operation with 6 engineers. Turns out managing hardware that hashes and hardware that makes sound isn't that different.
