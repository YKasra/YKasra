### Kasra Yaraei — Bucharest, Romania

I break things apart to understand how they work — whether that's an audio waveform, a crypto market cycle, or a classic analog synthesizer.

Started in **sound engineering** → ran **trading desks and mining farms** → now writing **DSP-powered trading algorithms** for my master's dissertation. The common thread? **Signal processing.**

### `> now`

**Crypto Cycle Detection System** — *MSc Dissertation, In Progress*

Building a system that applies FFT, MESA, and Hilbert Transform to cryptocurrency price data to detect dominant market cycles and trade the peaks and troughs. Ships with a Streamlit dashboard for live backtesting against MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

### `> past`

**Music Genre Classifier** · [repo →](https://github.com/YKasra/Classification-of-Music-Genres-Using-CNN-and-GTZAN-dataset)
CNN trained on 1,000 GTZAN samples. 94.89% test accuracy across 10 genres. 550 epochs of patience.
`TensorFlow` `Librosa` `Scikit-learn`

**Roland SH-101 Software Synth**
Full signal chain rebuilt in Pure Data — VCO, VCF, VCA, LFO, ADSR. From waveform to speaker.
`Pure Data` `DSP`

**Arduino Instruments**
Finger drum controller with touch pads. Ultrasonic sensors controlling pitch and volume in real-time. Hardware meets software.
`Arduino` `C++` `Pure Data`

### `> before code`

Head of Trading & Digital Assets — managed a **$100K+ crypto portfolio** and a **1,000 TH/s mining farm** with a team of 6 engineers. It turns out managing hardware that hashes and hardware that makes sound isn't that different.
